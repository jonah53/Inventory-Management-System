# Inventory-Management-System
It was designed to facilitate supplies inventory management, particularly for the electrification of rural areas. 
 A particular area is identified, the survey is done and data is stored and forwarded to the project manager who writes down the necessary budget and requisitions which are then forwarded to the warehouse for approval. The warehouse manager approves the requisition and items are moved to the temporary site where they will be ready for deployment and the quality manager will verify if the materials in the requisition are exactly what was used
